          <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio. I am currently a second-year student studying a Bachelor of Design Computing at the University of Sydney. I aspire to be a freelance front-end developer. I have always enjoyed solving problems and liked coding my own creative ideas. I love seeing my ideas come to life through coding. I enjoy usinng Figma to create my unique designs. If I have any free time, it would be trying to learn something about a coding language either on Youtube, linked in courses or Codecademy.</p>
